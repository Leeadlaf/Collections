### 12/07/2013 ~  KJS ~ Notes:

*	Ran into trouble trying to setup a server. 11:00 PM
	* I installed Apache Tomcat 7.0, MySQL, Eclipse ADT and Java EE on both my laptop and PC at home. 
	* It is simple enough to connect locally, but I tried connecting using web browser on phone and was unsuccessful.
	* Focusing on MySQL and Java Servlet for the remainder of the day.
	* Useful link for test cases: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysqltest/2.0/en/index.html

*	Considering using ORMLite to link Collection and Items, similar to HW3. If it does not work, highly consider using a "Collections" and "UserID" property for items.

**Android Side**

*UAB EE433 - Team 2 - Android Phone App - Collection$*

### 11/15/2013  ~  LWA  ~  Notes:

*	Android Studio?  _unfinished product for creating applications.  Looks promising_
*	When creating a new package, the package name must **not** contain any CAPS.
*	Created small .jpg file to test Icon creation (collections icon1.jpg)
*	New Folder for testing android side - suggest we create multiple as we get into the process (Test Version 01)
*	Good Demo for creating a new Android App: <http://www.vogella.com/articles/Android/article.html>
*   **I suggest Everyone keep a running list, _in multimarkdown format_, of what they do each day they work on a part of development.  Either in the README document of the appropriate folder or another one added to the folder.**

### 11/19/2013  ~  KJS  ~  Notes:

*	Created Item.java
*	Created Collection.java
*	**Kuni (and everyone), please update this file about what you did / accomplished when committing to the _android side_.  Keeping these log files up-to-date will help us.**

### 11/20/2013  ~  LWA  ~  Notes:

*	For fun, I used 'Android Studio' to create a new application: _Collection$_ (Test Version 01)
	*	Ignored GIT errors within 'Android Studio' (since we're using GitHub for Windows)
	*	Annoying Problems / Errors - Too buggy to use?
*	After giving up on 'Android Studio' I used 'ADT' to create a new application: _Collection$_ (Test Version 02)
	*	Auto-generated package / files - main java/class file is: MainActivity.java - can be refactored
	*	'Hello World' working correctly (Using **Nexus S** as my virtual android device)
	*	Starting to work strictly on the interface (GUI) - based on our Mindmap / Lucid Chart Presentation - not messing with class files at all.  Creating global variables for inputs / buttons / etc...   In progress...

### 11/21/2013  ~  LWA  ~  Notes:

*	General screen Layout is created through .xml code.  When a new Activity (screen, basically) is created, a Java class file and corresponding .xml file are made.
*	Good tutorial for switching screens in android development: <http://www.androidhive.info/2011/08/how-to-switch-between-activities-in-android/>
*	Still working on making basic screens (but a couple are started - and working on an emulator - if anyone wants to take a look) - assigning ids to buttons / text fields.  the .xml editor inside eclipse allows for id refactoring and reference (it's very useful)

### 11/21/2013  ~  RDF  ~  Notes:

*	Finally able to load windows app for GITHUB on computer after assistance from team members.
*	Still experiencing problems running Eclipse for the android application on my computer.
*	While trying to solve Eclipse problem, I found firebase application to launch an android app.
*	Plan to watch youtube video on hello world android app and work on getting Eclipse to run, but on Tomcat software for server.

### 11/28/2013 ~ KJS ~ Notes:

*	Researching information on interfacing MySQL database with Android.
	*	Will need to use ORM
	* 	Until rest of details are clear, work on Android classes will be put on hold. (Need to know how to store object information, call it, etc.)
*	Installed Apache Tomcat 7.0.47 and currently working on setup.
*	Expect progress to be made over the course of the next few days.


### Next Date...  ~  initials  ~  Notes:

*	Keep Calm and Carry On

**Android Side**

*UAB EE433 - Team 2 - Android Phone App - Collection$*

### 11/15/2013  ~  LWA  ~  Notes:

*	Android Studio?  _unfinished product for creating applications.  Looks promising_
*	When creating a new package, the package name must **not** contain any CAPS.
*	Created small .jpg file to test Icon creation (collections icon1.jpg)
*	New Folder for testing android side - suggest we create multiple as we get into the process (Test Version 01)
*	Good Demo for creating a new Android App: <http://www.vogella.com/articles/Android/article.html>
*   **I suggest Everyone keep a running list, _in multimarkdown format_, of what they do each day they work on a part of development.  Either in the README document of the appropriate folder or another one added to the folder.**

### 11/19/2013  ~  KJS  ~  Notes:

*	Created Item.java
*	Created Collection.java
*	**Kuni (and everyone), please update this file about what you did / accomplished when committing to the _android side_.  Keeping these log files up-to-date will help us.**

### 11/20/2013  ~  LWA  ~  Notes:

*	For fun, I used 'Android Studio' to create a new application: _Collection$_ (Test Version 01)
	*	Ignored GIT errors within 'Android Studio' (since we're using GitHub for Windows)
	*	Annoying Problems / Errors - Too buggy to use?
*	After giving up on 'Android Studio' I used 'ADT' to create a new application: _Collection$_ (Test Version 02)
	*	Auto-generated package / files - main java/class file is: MainActivity.java - can be refactored
	*	'Hello World' working correctly (Using **Nexus S** as my virtual android device)
	*	Starting to work strictly on the interface (GUI) - based on our Mindmap / Lucid Chart Presentation - not messing with class files at all.  Creating global variables for inputs / buttons / etc...   In progress...

### Next Date...  ~  initials  ~  Notes:

*	Keep Calm and Carry On

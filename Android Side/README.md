*UAB EE433 - Team 2 - Android Phone App - Collection$*

### 11/15/2013  ~  LWA  ~  Notes:

*	Android Studio?  _unfinished product for creating applications.  Looks promising_
*	When creating a new package, the package name must **not** contain any CAPS.
*	Created small .jpg file to test Icon creation (collections icon1.jpg)
*	New Folder for testing android side - suggest we create multiple as we get into the process (Test Version 01)
*	Good Demo for creating a new Android App: <http://www.vogella.com/articles/Android/article.html>
*   **I suggest Everyone keep a running list, _in multimarkdown format_, of what they do each day they work on a part of development.  Either in the README document of the appropriate folder or another one added to the folder.**

### Next Date...  ~  initials  ~  Notes:

*	Keep Calm and Carry On
